# magento2-theme-frontend-brons

Magento 2 theme based on Blank that removes some unwanted styling and makes it easier to replace or customize some components. Includes modified templates and scripts from some of Magento's modules.

This theme is not complete, it excludes many layout updates, custom navigation, replaced product gallery and custom minicart dependencies that I created for a client. Still, it can be useful as a starting point when a custom Magento storefront is needed.
